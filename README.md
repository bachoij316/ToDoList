ToDoList with using Vanilla JavaScript

To Do List is made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Implemented table frame for the lists with HTML first. The algorithm of addition, checked deletion, and all deletion were implemented in JavaScript. Strike-through on text and timer are implemented with JavaScript functions. 

When the 'Add' button clicked, the text box pops up and if nothing submitted, it gives an alert to put something, and when a job is submitted, second text box pops up which is about due for the job. The list can be added as many as the user put in, and strike-through a list by checking the check boxes. The checked lists can be removed by clicking 'Delete Checked' button and 'Delete All' button clear all lists.
